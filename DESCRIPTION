Description: Statial is a suite of functions for identifying changes in cell 
    state. The functionality provided by Statial provides robust quantification 
    of cell type localisation which are invariant to changes in tissue 
    structure. In addition to this Statial uncovers changes in marker expression
    associated with varying levels of localisation. These features can be used 
    to explore how the structure and function of different cell types may be 
    altered by the agents they are surrounded with.
