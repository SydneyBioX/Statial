\title{Get statistic from pairwise L curve of a single image.}
\usage{
getPairwise(x, from, to, dist = 50, integrate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A segmentedCells or data frame that contains at least the variables x and y, giving the location of each cell, and cellType.}

\item{from}{The 'from' cellType for generating the L curve.}

\item{to}{The 'to' cellType for generating the L curve.}

\item{dist}{The distance at which the statistic is obtained.}

\item{integrate}{Should the statistic be the integral from 0 to dist, or the value of the L curve at dist.}
}
\value{
Statistic from pairwise L curve of a single image.
}
