\usage{
spatialREMMulti(
  x,
  whichCondition = NULL,
  dist = 50,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A SegmentedCellExperiment or data frame that contains at least the variables x and y, giving the location of each cell, and cellType.}

\item{whichCondition}{Vector containing the two conditions to be analysed.}

\item{dist}{The distance at which the statistic is obtained.}

\item{integrate}{Should the statistic be the integral from 0 to dist, or the value of the L curve at dist.}

\item{donor}{Vector of donor IDs corresponding to each image if x is a data frame.}

\item{condition}{Vector of conditions corresponding to each image if x is a data frame.}

\item{nsim}{Number of simulations to perform. If empty, the p-value from lmerTest is used.}
}
\value{
Data frame of p-values.
